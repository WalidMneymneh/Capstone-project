# Capstone-project
The objective of this project was to leverage machine learning techniques, enabling automated quality detection and reducing the reliance on manual inspection. To achieve this, a robust dataset consisting of labeled samples indicating defect or non-defect status was collected along with 298 files containing sensor data for variables related to each asset used during the stamping process. Using this dataset, a random forest model model was developed in combination of the ensemble method, trained, and evaluated. Through extensive experimentation and optimization, the model achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting defects, demonstrating its effectiveness in automating the quality detection process.
